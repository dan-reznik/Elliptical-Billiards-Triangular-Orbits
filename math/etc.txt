<b>Long ago,</b> someone drew a triangle and three segments across it. Each segment started at a vertex and stopped at the midpoint of the opposite side. The segments met in a point. The person was impressed and repeated the experiment on a different shape of triangle. Again the segments met in a point. The person drew yet a third triangle, very carefully, with the same result. He told his friends. To their surprise and delight, the coincidence worked for them, too. Word spread, and the magic of the three segments was regarded as the work of a higher power.
<p>
Centuries passed, and someone <i><b>proved</b></i> that the three medians do indeed concur in a point, now called the <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/centroid.html" style="font-style: italic">centroid</a>. The ancients found other points, too, now called the <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/incenter.html" style="font-style: italic">incenter</a>, <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/ccenter.html" style="font-style: italic">circumcenter</a>, and <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/class/orthocn.html" style="font-style: italic">orthocenter</a>. More centuries passed, more special points were discovered, and a definition of <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/roads.html" style="font-style: italic">triangle center</a> emerged. Like the definition of continuous function, this definition is satisfied by infinitely many objects, of which only finitely many will ever be published. The Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers (ETC) extends a list of 400 triangle centers published in the 1998 book <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/tcct.html" style= "font-style: italic">Triangle Centers and Central Triangles</a>. For subsequent developments, click Links (one of the buttons atop this page). In particular, Eric Weisstein's <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/" style= "font-weight: bold">MathWorld</a>, covers much of classical and modern triangle geometry, including sketches and references.
</p><p>
A site in which triangle centers play a central role is Bernard Gibert's <a href="https://bernard-gibert.pagesperso-orange.fr/index.html" style="font-weight: bold">Cubics in the Triangle Plane</a>. Special points and properties of 4-sided plane figures are closely associated with triangle centers; see Chris van Tienhoven's <a href="https://chrisvantienhoven.nl/9-mathematics/encyclopedia-of-quadri-figures/3-encyclopedia-of-quadri-figures" style= "font-weight: bold">Encyclopedia of Quadri-Figures (EQF)</a>.
<br><br>
<h2>HOW TO USE ETC</h2>
You won't have to scroll down very far to find well known centers. Other named centers can be found using your computer's searcher - for example, search for "Apollonius" to find "Apollonius point" as X(181).
</p><p>
To determine if a possibly new center is already listed, click <b>Tables</b> at the top of this page and scroll to "Search 6.9.13". If you're unsure of a term, click <b>Glossary</b>. For visual constructions of selected centers with text, click <b>Sketches</b>. To learn about the triangle geometry interest group, Hyacinthos and other resources, or to view acknowledgments or supplementary encyclopedic material, click <b>Links</b>, <b>Thanks</b>, or <b>Tables</b>.
</p></p>
Under <b>Tables</b>, you can find <b>Search_13_6_9</b> (and two other Searches), which can be used to determine whether a newly discovered point is already in ETC. For such a search, be sure to visit Ron Knott's <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Triangle/tricoords.html"> <b>Triangle Convertor for Cartesian, Trilinear and Barycentric Coordinates</b></a>.
</p><p>
If you have The Geometer's Sketchpad, you can view sketches of many of the triangle centers. These are <b>dynamic</b> sketches, meaning that you can vary the shape of the reference triangle A, B, C by dragging these vertices. (For information on Sketchpad, click <a href="http://www.dynamicgeometry.com/" style="font-weight: bold">Sketchpad</a>.) The sketches are also useful for making your own Sketchpad tools, so that you can quickly construct X-of-T for many choices of X and T. For example, starting with ABC and point P, you could efficiently construct center X of the four triangles ABC, BCP, CAP, ABP.
</p><p>
The algebraic definition of triangle center (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangleCenterFunction.html">MathWorld</a>) admits points whose <i>geometric</i> interpretation for fixed numerical sidelengths a,b,c is not "central." Roger Smyth offers this example: on the domain of scalene triangles, define f(a,b,c) = 1 for a&gt;b and a&gt;c and f(a,b,c) = 0 otherwise; then f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b) is a triangle center which picks out the vertex opposite the longest side. Such centers turn out to be useful, as, for example, when distinguishing between the Fermat point and the 1st isogonic center; see the note at X(13).
</p>
<h3>NOTATION AND COORDINATES</h3>
<p class="auto-style2">The reference triangle is ABC, with sidelengths a,b,c. Each triangle
center P has homogeneous trilinear coordinates, or simply <a href= "http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/tcenters/trilin.html" style="font-weight: bold">trilinears</a>, of the form x : y : z. This means that there is a nonzero function h of (a,b,c) such that
</p><p>
x = hx', y = hy', z = hz',
<br> <p class="auto-style2">where x', y', z' denote the directed distances from P to sidelines BC, CA, AB. Likewise, u : v : w are <b>barycentrics</b> if there is a function k of (a,b,c) such that
</p><p>
u = ku', v = kv', w = kw',
<br> <p class="auto-style2">where u', v', w' denote the signed areas of triangles PBC, PCA, PAB. Both coordinate systems are widely used; if trilinears for a point are x : y : z, then barycentrics are ax : by : cz.
</p><p>
In order that every center should have its own name, in cases where no particular name arises from geometrical or historical considerations, the name of a star is used instead. For example, X(770) is POINT ACAMAR. For a list of star names, visit <a href="http://www.obliquity.com/skyeye/misc/name.html">SkyEye - (Un)Common Star Names</a>.

<h3>Introduced on March 21, 2015: Shinagawa coefficients for triangle centers on the Euler line</h3>
Suppose that X is a triangle center given by barycentric coordinates f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b). The Shinagawa coefficients of X are the functions G(a,b,c) and H(a,b,c) such that
</p> <p>
f(a,b,c) = G(a,b,c)*S<sup>2</sup> + H(a,b,c)*S<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub>.
</p> <p>
For many choices of X, G(a,b,c) and H(a,b,c) are conveniently expressed in terms of the following:
</p> <p>
E = (S<sub>B</sub> + S<sub>C</sub>)(S<sub>C</sub> + S<sub>A</sub>)(S<sub>A</sub> + S<sub>B</sub>)/S<sup>2</sup>, so that E = (abc/S)<sup>2</sup> = 4R<sup>2</sup>
<br>
F = S<sub>A</sub>S<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub>/S<sup>2</sup>, so that F = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)/2 - 4R<sup>2</sup> = S<sub>&omega;</sub> - 4R<sup>2</sup>
</p> <p>
Examples:<br>
X(2) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, 0); i.e., X(2) = 1*S<sup>2</sup> + 0*S<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub><br>
X(3) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, -1)<br>
X(4) has Shinagawa coefficients (0, 1)<br>
X(5) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, 1)<br>
X(23) has Shinagawa coefficients (E + 4F, -4E - 4F)<br>
X(1113) has Shinagawa coefficients (R - |OH|, -3R + |OH|)<br>
</p> <p>
A cyclic sum notation, $...$, is introduced here especially for use with Shinagawa coefficients. For example, $aS<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub>$ abbreviates aS<sub>B</sub>S<sub>C</sub> + bS<sub>C</sub>S<sub>A</sub> + cS<sub>A</sub>S<sub>B</sub>.
</p> <p>
Example: X(21) has Shinagawa coefficients ($aS<sub>A</sub>$, abc - $aS<sub>A</sub>$)
</p> <p>
If a point X has Shinagawa coefficients (u,v) where u and v are real numbers (i.e, G(a,b,c) and H(a,b,c) are constants), then the segment joining X and X(2) is giving by |GX| = 2v|GO|/(3u + v), where |GO| = (E - 8F)<sup>1/2</sup>/6. Then the equation |GX| = 2v|GO|/(3u + v) can be used to obtain these combos:
</p> <p>
X = [(u + v)/2]*X(2) - (v/3)*X(3)<br>
X = u*X(2) + (v/3)*X(4)<br>
X = u*X(3) + [(u + v)/2]*X(4).
</p> <p>
The function F is also given by these identities: <br>
F = (4R<sup>2</sup> - 36|GO|<sup>2</sup>)/8 and F = R<sup>2</sup>( 1 - J<sup>2</sup>)/2, where J = |OH|/R.

<h3>Introduced on November 1, 2011: Combos </h3>
<p>
Suppose that P and U are finite points having normalized barycentric coordinates (p,q,r) and (u,v,w). (Normalized means that p + q + r = 1 and u + v + w = 1.) Suppose that f = f(a,b,c) and g = g(a,b,c) are nonzero homogeneous functions having the same degree of homogeneity. Let x = fp + gu, y = fq + gv, z = fr + gw. <b>The (f,g) combo of P and U, denoted by f*P + g*U, is introduced here as the point X = x : y : z (homogeneous barycentric coordinates);
</b>
the normalized barycentric coordinates of X are (kx,ky,kz), where k=1/(x+y+z).
</p><p>
<b>Note 1.</b> If P and U are given by normalized trilinear coordinates (instead of barycentric), then f*P + g*U has homogeneous trilinears fp+gu : fq+gv : fr+gw, which is symbolically identical to the homogenous barycentrics for f*P + g*U. The normalized trilinear coordinates for X are (hx,hy,hz), where h=2*area(ABC))/(ax + by + cz).
</p><p>
<b>Note 2.</b> The definition of combo readily extends to finite sets of finite points. In particular, the (f,g,h) combo of P = (p,q,r), U = (u,v,w), J = (j,k,m) is given by fp + gu + hj : fq + gv + hk : fr + gw + hm and denoted by f*P + g*U + h*J.
</p><p>
<b>Note 3.</b> f*P + g*U is collinear with P and U, and its {P,Q}-harmonic conjugate is fp - gu : fq - gv : fr - gw.
</p><p>
<b>Note 4.</b> Suppose that f,g,h are homogeneous symmetric functions all of the same degree of homogeneity, and suppose that X, X', X" are triangle centers. Then f*X + g*X' + h*X'' is a triangle center.
</p><p>
<b>Note 5.</b> Suppose that X, X', X'', X''' are triangle centers and X', X'', X''' are not collinear. Then there exist f,g,h as in Note 4 such that X = f*X' + g*X'' + h*X'''. That is, loosely speaking, every triangle center is a linear combination of any other three noncollinear triangle centers.
</p><p>
<b>Note 6.</b> Continuing from Note 5, examples of f,g,h are conveniently given using Conway symbols for a triangle ABC with sidelengths a,b,c. Conway symbols and certain classical symbols are
identified here:
</p><p>
S = 2*area(ABC)<br>
S<sub>A</sub> = (b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>)/2 = bc cos A<br>
S<sub>B</sub> = (c<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>)/2 = ca cos B<br>
S<sub>C</sub> = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>)/2 = ab cos C<br>
S<sub>&omega;</sub> = S cot &omega;<br>
s = (a + b + c)/2<br>
s<sub>a</sub> = (b + c - a)/2<br>
s<sub>b</sub> = (c + a - b)/2<br>
s<sub>c</sub> = (a + b - c)/2<br>
r = inradius = S/(a + b + c)<br>
R = circumradius = abc/(2S)<br>
cot(&omega;) = (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)/(2S), where &omega; is the Brocard angle
</p><p>
<b>Note 7.</b> The definition of combo along with many examples were developed by Peter Moses prior to November 1, 2011. After that combos have been further developed by Peter Moses, Randy Hutson, and Clark Kimberling.
</p><p>
Examples of two-point combos:<br><b>X(175) = 2s*X(1) - (r + 4R)*X(7)<br>X(176) = 2s*X(1) + (r + 4R)*X(7)<br>X(481) = s*X(1) - (r + 4R)*X(7)<br>X(482) = s*X(1) + (r + 4R)*X(7)
</b></p><p>
Examples of three-point combos: see below at X(1), X(2), etc.
</p><p>
<b>Note 8.</b> Suppose that T is a (central) triangle with vertices A',B',C' given by normalized barycentrics. Then T is represented by a 3x3 matrix with row sums equal to 1. Let NT denote the set of these matrices and let * denote matrix multiplication. Then NT is closed under *. Also, NT is closed under matrix inversion, so that (NT, *) is a group. Once normalized, any central T can be used to produce triangle centers as combos of the form Xcom(nT); see the preambles to X(3663) and X(3739).

Writing the A-exradius as r(a,b,c), the others are r(b,c,a) and r(c,a,b). If these exradii are abbreviated as r<sub>a</sub>, r<sub>b</sub>, r<sub>c</sub>, then 1/r = 1/r<sub>a</sub> +1/r<sub>b</sub> + 1/r<sub>c</sub>. Moreover,

Let O<sub>A</sub> be the circle tangent to side BC at its midpoint and to the circumcircle on the side of BC opposite A. Define O<sub>B</sub> and O<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let L<sub>A</sub> be the external tangent to circles O<sub>B</sub> and O<sub>C</sub> that is nearest to O<sub>A</sub>. Define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let A' = L<sub>B</sub> &cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically. Then triangle A'B'C' is homothetic to the medial triangle, and the center of homothety is X(1); see the reference at X(1001).

As a point on the Euler line, X(2) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, 0).
</p><p>
X(2) is the point of concurrence of the medians of ABC, situated 1/3 of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. More generally, if L is any line in the plane of ABC, then the distance from X(2) to L is the average of the distances from A, B, C to L. An idealized triangular sheet balances atop a pin head located at X(2) and also balances atop any knife-edge that passes through X(2). The triangles BXC, CXA, AXB have equal areas if and only if X = X(2).

X(3) is the point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of
the sides of ABC. The lengths of segments AX, BX, CX are equal if and
only if X = X(3). This common distance is the radius of the
circumcircle, which passes through vertices A,B,C. Called the
circumradius, it is given by R = a/(2 sin A) = abc/(4*area(ABC)).
</p><p>
The tangents at vertices of excentral triangle to the McCay cubic K003 concur in X(3). Also, the tangents at A,B,C to the orthocubic K006 concur in X(3). (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

X(4) and the vertices A,B,C comprise an orthocentric system, defined
as a set of four points, one of which is the orthocenter of the
triangle of the other three (so that each is the orthocenter of the
other three). The incenter and excenters also form an orthocentric
system. If ABC is acute, then X(4) is the incenter of the orthic
triangle.
</p><p>
Suppose P is not on a sideline of ABC. Let A'B'C' be the cevian
triangle of P. Let D,E,F be the circles having diameters AA', BB',CC'.
The radical center of D,E,F is X(4). (Floor van Lamoen, Hyacinthos

Let A2B2C2 be the 2nd Conway triangle. Let A' be the crosspoint of B2 and C2, and define B' and C' cyclically. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(4). (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)

X(5) is the center of the nine-point circle. Euler showed in that
this circle passes through the midpoints of the sides of ABC and the
feet of the altitudes of ABC, hence six of the nine points. The other
three are the midpoints of segments A-to-X(4), B-to-X(4), C-to-X(4).
The radius of the nine-point circle is one-half the circumradius.</p>

Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of an arbitrary point X, and let S(X) be the vector sum XA' + XB' + XC'. Then
</p><p>
S(X) = (0 vector) if and only if X = X(6).
</p><p>
The "if" implication is equivalent to the well known fact that X(6) is the centroid of its pedal triangle, and the converse was proved by Barry Wolk (Hyacinthos #19, Dec. 23, 1999).

Construct the equilateral triangle BA'C having base BC and vertex A' on the negative side of BC; similarly construct equilateral triangles CB'A and AC'B based on the other two sides. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(13). If each of the angles A, B, C is &lt; 2&pi;/3, then X(13) is the only center X for which the angles BXC, CXA, AXB are equal, and X(13) minimizes the sum |AX| + |BX| + |CX|. The antipedal triangle of X(13) is equilateral.
</p><p>
If, however, A&gt; 2&pi;/3, then the Fermat point, defined geometrically as the minimizer of |AX| + |BX| + |CX|, is not the 1st isogonic center (which is defined by the above trilinears). Trilinears for the Fermat point when A&gt; 2&pi;/3 are simply 1:0:0. To represent the Fermat point in the form f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), one must use Boolean variables, as shown at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_point">Fermat point.</a>

Let A' be the center of the conic through the contact points of the incircle and the A-excircle with the sidelines of ABC. Define B' and C' cyclically. Let A" be the center of the conic through the contact points of the B- and C- excircles with the sidelines of ABC. Define B" and C" cyclically. Let A* be the midpoint of A' and A", and define B* and C* cyclically. The triangle A*B*C* is perspective to ABC at X(25). See also X(6), X(218), X(222), X(940), X(1743).

Let A' be the radical center of the nine-point circle and the B- and C-power circles. efine B' and C' cyclically. The triangle A'B'C' is homothetic with the orthic triangle, and the center of homothety is X(25). Also X(25) is the point of intersection of these two lines: isotomic conjugate of polar conjugate of van Aubel line (i.e., line X(2)X(3)), and polar conjugate of isotomic conjugate of van Aubel line (i.e., line X(25)X(393)). Also, X(25) is the trilinear pole of line X(512)X(1692), this line being the isogonal conjugate of the isotomic conjugate of the orthic axis; the line X(512)X(1692) is also the polar of X(76) wrt polar circle, and the line is also the radical axis of circumcircle and 2nd Lemoine circle.

Let A'B'C' be the orthic triangle. Let A" be the barycentric product of the (real or imaginary) circumcircle intercepts of line B'C'. Define B", C" cyclically. The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(25). (Randy Hutson, October 27, 2015)

The 2nd Ehrmann triangle, defined in the preamble to X(8537), can be generalized as follows. Let P be a point in the plane of ABC and not on BC&cup;CA&cup;AB. Let Ab the the point of intersection of the circle {{P,B,C}} and the line AB, and define Bc and Ca cyclically. Define Ac symmetrically, and define Ba and Cb cyclically. Let A' = BcBa&cap;CaCb, and define B' and C' cyclically. Triangle A'B'C', here introduced as the <b>P-Ehrmann triangle</b>, is homothetic to the orthic triangle. The X(1)-Ehrmann triangle is the intangents triangle, and the X(6)-Ehrmann triangle is the 2nd Ehrmann triangle. If P lies on the circumcircle, the P-Ehrmann triangle is the tangential triangle. If P is on the Brocard 2nd cubic K018 or the circumcircle, then the P-Ehrmann triangle is perspective to ABC. The homothetic center of the orthic triangle and the X(4)-Ehrmann triangle is X(25).

Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC, not on a sideline of ABC. Let A1 be the isogonal conjugate of A with respect to triangle BCP, and define B1, C1 cyclically. Call triangle A1B1C1 the 1st isogonal triangle of P. A1B1C1 is also the reflection triangle of the isogonal conjugate of P. A1B1C1 is perspective to ABC iff P lies on the Neuberg cubic. The perspector lies on cubic K060 (pK(X1989, X265), O(X5) orthopivotal cubic). Let A2 be the isogonal conjugate of A1 with respect to triangle B1C1P, and define B2, C2 cyclically. Call triangle A2B2C2 the 2nd isogonal triangle of P. Continuing, let An be the isogonal conjugate of A(n-1) with respect to triangle B(n-1)C(n-1)P, and define B(n), C(n) cyclically. Call triangle AnBnCn the nth isogonal triangle of P. For n >= 2, all triangles AnBnCn are perspective to A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1). Call the perspector, Pn, the nth isogonal perspector of P. Pn is the orthocenter of A(n-1)B(n-1)C(n-1) and either the incenter or an excenter of AnBnCn. The triangles AnBnCn are all concyclic, with P as center. Call the circle the isogonal circle of P. For P = X(1), the 2nd isogonal triangle of X(1) is homothetic to ABC at X(36); see also X(35), X(1478), X(1479), X(3583), X(3585), X(5903), X(7741), X(7951). (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

X(37) = (r<sup>2</sup> + 2rR - s<sup>2</sup>)*X(1) - 6rR*X(2) - 2r<sup>2</sup>*X(3) (Peter Moses, April 2, 2013)

Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(1). Let A" be the centroid of
triangle AB'C', and define B" and C" cyclically. Then the lines AA",
BB", CC" concur in X(37). (Eric Danneels, Hyacinthos 7892, 9/13/03)
</p><p>
A simple construction of X(37) as a crosspoint can be generalized as
follows: let DEF be the medial triangle of ABC and let A'B'C' be the
cevian triangle of a point U other than the centroid, X(2). The
crosspoint of X(2) and U is then the point of concurrence of lines
LD,ME,NF, where L,M,N are the respective midpoints of AA', BB', CC'. If
U=u : v : w (trilinears), then crosspoint(X(2),U) = b/w+c/v : c/u+a/w :
a/v+b/u, assuming that uvw is nonzero. In particular, if U=X(1), then
the crosspoint is X(37). (Seiichi Kirikami, July 10, 2011)

Let Oa be the A-extraversion of the Conway circle (the circle centered at the A-excenter and passing through A, with radius sqrt(r<sub>a</sub>^2 + s^2), where r<sub>a</sub> is the A-exradius).

Suppose that P and Q are distinct points in the plane of a triangle ABC . Let P<sub>A</sub> = reflection of P in line AQ, let Q<sub>A</sub> = reflection of Q in line AP, and let M<sub>A</sub> = midpoint of segment P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>. Define M<sub>B</sub> and M<sub>C</sub> cyclically. C�sar Lozada found that if Q = isogonal conjugate of P, then the locus of P for which M<sub>A</sub>M<sub>B</sub>M<sub>C</sub> is perspective to ABC is the union of a cubic and 6 circles: specifically, the McCay cubic (K003), the circles {{B,C,B',C'}}, {{C,A,C',A'}}, {{A,B,A',B'}}, and the circles {{B,C,A'}}, {{C,A,B'}}, {{A,B,C'}}, where A',B',C' are the excenters of ABC. Moreover, if P = X(3) and Q = X(4), then M<sub>A</sub>M<sub>B</sub>M<sub>C</sub> is not only perspective, but homothetic, to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(49).

Let P be a point on the Steiner circumellipse. Let A' be the orthocenter of BCP, and define B' and C' cyclically. Let Q be the centroid of A'B'C'. The locus of Q as P varies is an ellipse similar and orthogonal to the Steiner circumellipse, and also centered at X(2). When P = X(671), Q = X(98). See also X(6054) and X(24808).

X(110) is the center of the Stammler hyperbola, SH, which is the rectangular hyperbola that passes through X(1), X(3), X(6), X(155), X(159), X(195), X(399), X(1498), X(2916), X(2917), X(2918), X(2929), X(2930), X(2931), X(2935), X(2948), X(3511), the excenters, and the vertices of the tangential triangle. SH is the bianticevian conic of X(1) and X(6) and the antipedal-anticevian conic of X(3). SH is the tangential isogonal conjugate of the Euler line, the tangential isotomic conjugate of the van Aubel line, the excentral isogonal conjugate of line X(30)X(40), and the excentral isotomic conjugate of line X(191)X(2938). SH is tangent to the Euler line at X(3) and meets the line at infinity (and the Jerabek hyperbola, other than at X(3) and X(6)) at X(2574) and X(2575). SH is the locus of a point P for which the P-Brocard triangle is perspective to ABC. (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011, 1/29/2015)

Scimemi proves that if the Euler line is reflected in every side of triangle ABC, then the three reflections concur in X(110).

Seven constructions from Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015:
</p><p>
(1) Let P be a point, other than X(4), on Euler line. Let A' be the reflection of P in BC, and define B' and C' cyclically. The circumcircles of AA'B', BC'A', and CA'B' concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(2) Let Q be a point on line X(2)X(6) other than X(2). Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of Q. Let A" be the {B,C}-harmonic conjugate of A' (or equivalently, A" = BC&cap;B'C'), and define B", C" cyclically. The circumcircles of AB"C", BC"A", CA"B" concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(3) Let La, Lb, Lc be the lines through A, B, C, resp. parallel to the Euler line. Let Ma, Mb, Mc be the reflections of BC, CA, AB in La, Lb, Lc, resp. Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B', C' cyclically. Triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to, and 3 times the size of, ABC. Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Euler line. The triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, with center of homothety X(125) and centroid X(110). (See Hyacinthos #16741/16782, Sep 2008.)
</p><p>
(4) Let A', B', C' be the intersections of the Lemoine axis and lines BC, CA, AB, resp. The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(5) Let A', B', C' be the intersections of line X(36)X(238) and lines BC, CA, AB, resp. The circumcircles of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B' concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(6) Let A', B', C' be the intersections of the Euler line and lines BC, CA, AB, resp. Let Oa, Ob, Oc be the circumcenters of AB'C', BC'A', CA'B', resp. The lines AOa, BOb, COc concur in X(110).
</p><p>
(7) Let Na be the reflection of X(5) in the perpendicular bisector of BC, and define Nb, Nc cyclically. X(110) = X(2070) of NaNbNc.
</p><p>
Let A2B2C2 and A3B3C3 be the 2nd and 3rd Parry triangles. Let A' be the barycentric product A2*A3, and define B' and C' cyclically. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(110). (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)
</p><p>
Let A'B'C' be the triangle described in ADGEOM #2697 (8/26/2015, Tran Quang Hung). A'B'C' is homothetic to the anticomplementary triangle at X(110). The nine-point circle of A'B'C' touches the circumcircle of ABC at X(110). Also, X(110) = X(125)-of-A'B'C'. (Randy Hutson, Novermber 2, 2016)

the cyclic quadrilateral ABCX'. Let H<sub>A</sub> be the orthocenter of
triangle BCX, Let H<sub>B</sub> be the orthocenter of CAX, and let
H<sub>C</sub> be the orthocenter of triangle ABX. Then the
quadrilateral HH<sub>A</sub>H<sub>B</sub>H<sub>C</sub> is homothetic to

X(125) is the pole of the Fermat axis with respect to the Dao-Moses-Telv circle. (Randy Hutson, December 14, 2014)

Let La, Lb, Lc be the lines through A, B, C, resp. parallel to the Euler line. Let Ma, Mb, Mc be the reflections of BC, CA, AB in La, Lb, Lc, resp. Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B', C' cyclically. Triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to, and 3 times the size of, ABC. Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Euler line. The triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, with center of homothety X(125); see Hyacinthos #16741/16782, Sep 2008. (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)

Let A' be the midpoint between A and X(3), and define B' and C' cyclically; the triangle A'B'C' is homothetic to the medial triangle, and the center of homothety is X(140). Let A'' be the centroid of the triangle BCX(3), and define B'' and C'' cyclically; then A''B''C'' is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(140). Also, X(140) is the center of the conic consisting of the centers of all the conics which pass through A, B, C, and X(3). (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)
This conic is also the locus of crosssums of the intersections of the circumcircle and lines through X(4). Furthmore, this conic is the bicevian conic of X(2) and X(3). (Randy Hutson, 9/14/2016)

Let P be a point on the circumcircle. The bicevian conic of X(2) and P is a rectangular hyperbola, H. Let X be the center of H. As P varies, X traces a circle centered at X(140). (Randy Hutson, November 2, 2017)

Let Ea be the ellipse with B and C as foci and passing through X(1), and define Eb and Ec cyclically. Let La be the line tangent to Ea at X(1), and define Lb and Lc cyclically. Let A' = La&cap;BC, B' = Lb&cap;CA, C' = Lc&cap;AB. Then A', B', C' are collinear, and X(174) = trilinear pole of line A'B'C'. The line A'B'C' meets the line at infinity at the isogonal conjugate of X(3659). Alternately, let A" be the trilinear pole of line La, and define B" and C" cyclically. The lines AA", BB" and CC" concur at X(174); see also X(188). The points A", B", C" lie on the circumconic centered at X(9). (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)

Let A'B'C' be the excentral triangle. X(174) is the trilinear pole of the Monge line of the incircles of BCA', CAB', ABC'. (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)
<p></p>
In notes dated 1987, Yff raises this question concerning certain triangles lying within ABC: can isoscelizers (defined at X(173)), P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>, P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>, P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>, be constructed so that, on putting
</p><p>
R<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>&cap;P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>, R<sub>B</sub> = P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>&cap;P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>, R<sub>C</sub> = P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>&cap;P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>,
</p> <p>
the following four triangles are congruent:
</p> <p>
P<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>R<sub>A</sub>, P<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>R<sub>B</sub>,
P<sub>C</sub>Q<sub>C</sub>R<sub>C</sub>, R<sub>A</sub>R<sub>B</sub>R<sub>C</sub> ?
</p> <p>
After proving that the answer is yes, Yff moves the three isoscelizers in such a way that the three outer triangles, stay congruent and the inner triangle (called the Yff central triangle), R<sub>A</sub>R<sub>B</sub>R<sub>C</sub>, shrinks to X(174).

Let D be the point on side BC such that (angle BID) = (angle DIC), and likewise for point E on side CA and point F on side AB. The lines AD, BE, CF concur in X(174). (Seiichi Kirikami, Jan. 29, 2010)
</p> <p>
Generalization: if I is replaced by an arbitrary point P = p : q : r (trilinears), then the lines AD, BE, CF concur in the point K(P) = f(p,q,r,A) : f(q,r,p,B) : f(r,p,q,C), where f(p,q,r,A) = (q<sup>2</sup> + r<sup>2</sup> + 2qr cos A)<sup>-1/2</sup>. Moreover, if P* is the inverse of P in the circumcircle, then K(P*) = K(P). (Peter Moses, Feb. 1, 2010, based on Seiichi Kirikami's construction of X(174))

The points X(175) and X(176) are discussed in an 1890 article by Emile Lemoine, accessible at
<a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201173h">Gallica</a>. The article begins on page 111, and the two points are considered beginning on page 128.

A point X is defined as an isoperimetric point of triangle ABC if |XB| + |XC| + |BC| = |XC| + |XA| + |CA| = |XA| + |XB| + |AB|. Veldkamp established that X = X(175), uniquely, for some triangles ABC, but the conditions he gives are not correct. Hajja and Yff proved that the condition tan(A/2) + tan(B/2) + tan(C/2) &lt; 2 is necessary and sufficient. See also X(176) and the 1st and 2nd Eppstein points, X(481), X(482).
</p><p>
In unpublished notes, Yff proved that X(175) is the center of the outer Soddy circle. His proof later appeared in the paper by Hajja and Yff cited below.
</p><p>
Every point on the Soddy line has barycentric coordinates of the form a + k/sa : b + k/sb : c + k/sc, where k is a symmetric function in a,b,c, and sa=(b+c-a)/2, sb=(c+a-b)/2, sc=(a+b-c)/2. Writing S for 4*area(ABC):
</p><p>
X(175) = 2a - S/sa : 2b - S/sb : 2c - S/sc<br>
X(176) = 2a + S/sa : 2b + S/sb : 2c + S/sc<br>
X(481) = a - S/sa : b - S/sb : c - S/sc<br>
X(482) = a + S/sa : b + S/sb : c + S/sc<br>
X(1371) = a + 2S/(3 sa) : b + 2S/(3 sb) : c + 2S/(3 sc)<br>
X(1372) = a - 2S/(3 sa) : b - 2S/(3 sb) : c - 2S/(3 sc)<br>
X(1373) = a + 2S/sa : b + 2S/sb : c + 2S/sc<br>
X(1374) = a - 2S/sa : b - 2S/sb : c - 2S/sc<br>

There are exactly two points P such that the incircles of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are pairwise tangent to one another; the two points are X(175) and X(176).

The points X(175) and X(176) are discussed in an 1890 article by Emile Lemoine, accessible at <a href= "http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k201173h">Gallica</a>. The article begins on page 111, and the two points are considered beginning on page 128.
</p><p>
The following construction was found by Elkies: call two circles within ABC <i>companion circles</i> if they are the incircles of two triangles formed by dividing ABC into two smaller triangles by passing a line through one of the vertices and some point on the opposite side; chain of circles O(1), O(2), ... such that O(n),O(n+1) are companion incircles for every n consists of at most six distinct circles; there is a unique chain consisting of only three distinct circles; and for this chain, the three subdividing lines concur in X(176).
</p><p>
A point X is defined as a point of equal detour of triangle ABC if |XB| + |XC| - |BC| = |XC| + |XA| - |CA| = |XA| + |XB| - |AB|. Veldkamp established that X = X(176) for some triangles ABC, but the conditions he gives are not correct. Hajja and Yff proved that the condition tan(A/2) + tan(B/2) + tan(C/2) &lt; 2 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of exactly two points of equal detour and that the condition tan(A/2) + tan(B/2) + tan(C/2) = 2 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of exactly one point of equal detour. Yff found that X(176) is also is the center of the inner Soddy circle. See also X(175) and the 1st and 2nd Eppstein points, X(481), X(482).

There are exactly two points P such that the incircles of the triangles PBC, PCA, PAB are pairwise tangent to one another; the two points are X(175) and X(176). There are exactly two points P such that the radical center of the incircles of PBC, PCA, PAB is P; the two points are X(175) and X(176). For a point Q, let A' be the incenter of triangle BCQ, and define B' and C' cyclically; then X(176) is the only point Q such that Q is the incenter of A'B'C'. (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

X(184) is the homothetic center of triangles ABC and A'B'C', the
latter defined as follows: let B<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>1</sub> be the
points where the perpendicular bisector BC meets sidelines CA and AB,
and cyclically define C<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>; A<sub>3</sub>,
B<sub>3</sub>. Then A'B'C' is formed by the perpendicular bisectors of
segments B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>,
A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>. (Fred Lang, Hyacinthos #1190)
</p> <p>
X(184) is the subject of Hyacinthos messages 5423-5441 (May, 2002).
In #5423, Alexei Myakishev notes that X(184) serves as a common vertex
of three triangles inside ABC, mutually congruent and similar to ABC.
(The triangles can be labeled XB<sub>C</sub>C<sub>B</sub>,
XC<sub>A</sub>A<sub>C</sub>, XA<sub>B</sub>B<sub>A</sub>, with
B<sub>C</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> on side BC, C<sub>A</sub> and
A<sub>C</sub> on side CA, and A<sub>B</sub> and B<sub>A</sub> on side

<p>In #5435, Paul Yiu cites Fred Lang's construction of X(184) and
notes that the three triangles are then easily constructed from X(184).
The triangles determine three other triangles with common vertex

Randy Hutson notes that X(184) is the exsimilicenter of the circumcircle and sine-triple-angle circle. (December 14, 2014)
</p><p>
Let A'B'C' be the intersections, other than X(3), of the X(3)-cevians and the Brocard circle. Let A"B"C" be the intersections, other than X(6), of the X(6)-cevians and the Brocard circle. Then A'B'C' and A"B"C" are perspective at X(184). Also, X(184) = U&cap;V, where U = isotomic conjugate of polar conjugate of Brocard axis (i.e., line X(3)X(49)), and V = polar conjugate of isotomic conjugate of Brocard axis (i.e., line X(6)X(25)). Let DEF be the orthic triangle. Let D' be the isotomic conjugate of X(4) wrt AEF, and define E' and F' cyclically; then the lines AD', BE', CF' concur in X(184). (Randy Hutson, June 1, 2015)

</p><p>
(1) Let A'B'C' be the tangential triangle. Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically. The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(2) Let A'B'C' be the symmedial triangle. Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically. The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(3) Let A'B'C' be the circumsymmedial triangle. Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically. The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(4) Let A'B'C' be the Lucas(t) central triangle (for any t). Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B", C" cyclically. The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(264).
</p><p>
(5) X(264) is the trilinear pole of the line X(297)X(525). This line is the isotomic conjugate of the MacBeath circumconic, which is the isogonal conjugate of the orthic axis. The line is also the polar of X(6) wrt the polar circle, and the radical axis of the polar and orthosymmedial circles, and the polar conjugate of the circumcircle)

X(363) is the homothetic center of the excentral triangle and the
inner Hutson triangle. A construction of the latter follows. The
internal bisector of angle A meets the A-excircle in two points. Let
P<sub>A</sub> be the point closer to line BC and let Q<sub>A</sub> be
the other point. Define P<sub>B</sub> and P<sub>C</sub> cyclically, and
define Q<sub>B</sub> and Q<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let L<sub>A</sub> be
the line tangent to the A-excircle at P<sub>A</sub>, and define
L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let M<sub>A</sub> be the
line tangent to the A-excircle at Q<sub>A</sub>, and define
M<sub>B</sub> and M<sub>C</sub> cyclically. The inner Hutson triangle
is the triangle A'B'C' given by A' = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>,
B' = L<sub>C</sub>&cap;L<sub>A</sub>, C' =
L<sub>A</sub>&cap;L<sub>B</sub>; the outer Hutson triangle is given by
A'' = M<sub>B</sub>&cap;M<sub>C</sub>, B'' =
M<sub>C</sub>&cap;M<sub>A</sub>, C' = M<sub>A</sub>&cap;M<sub>B</sub>.
(Based on a description of A'B'C' by Randy Hutson, September 23,
2011)
</p><p>
Peter Moses (November 10, 2011) found trilinears for A'B'C' and A''B''C''. As these are central triangles, trilinears for A' and A'' suffice:
</p><p>
A' = aU<sub>A</sub>(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - 2bc - 2ca - 2ab) + bU<sub>B</sub>(b + c - a)(c + a - b) + cU<sub>C</sub>(b + c - a)(a + b - c)

<br>
: aU<sub>A</sub>(a<sup>2</sup> - 3b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2bc - 2ca + 2ab) - bU<sub>B</sub>(-a + b + c)(a - b + c) + U<sub>C</sub>(b - a)(-a + b + c)(a + b - c)
</p><p>
A'' = aU<sub>A</sub>(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - 2bc - 2ca - 2ab) - bU<sub>B</sub>(b + c - a)(c + a - b) - cU<sub>C</sub>(b + c - a)(a + b - c)

</p><p>
where U<sub>A</sub> = sqrt[bc/((a - b + c)(a + b - c)] = (1/2)csc(A/2), and U<sub>B</sub> and U<sub>C</sub> are defined cyclically.
</p><p>
A'B'C' is perspective to the following triangles: intouch, hexyl,Yff, and the 1st and 2nd circumperp triangles. A''B''C'' is perspective to these: ABC, intouch, hexyl, Yff, and the 1st and 2nd circumperp triangles. A'B'C' is homothetic to A''B''C'', which is perspective to the excentral triangle at X(168).

There exist three congruent squares U, V, W positioned in ABC as
follows: U has opposing vertices on segments AB and AC; V has opposing
vertices on segments BC and BA; W has opposing vertices on segments CA
and CB, and there is a single point common to U, V, W. The common
point, X(371), may have first been published in Kenmotu's <i>Collection
of Sangaku Problems</i> in 1840, indicating that its first appearance
may have been anonymously inscribed on a wooden board hung up in a
Japanese shrine or temple. (The Kenmotu configuration uses only
half-squares; i.e., isosceles right triangles). Trilinears were found
by John Rigby.
</p><p>
The edgelength of the three squares is
2<sup>1/2</sup>abc/(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> +
4&sigma;), where &sigma; = area(ABC). (Edward Brisse, 2/12/2000)</p>
<p>X(371) is the internal center of similitude of the circumcircle and
the 2nd Lemoine circle (cosine circle) (Peter J. C. Moses, 5/9/03).
Also, X(371) is the internal center of similitude of the Gallatly
circle (defined just before X(2007)) and the 1st Lemoine circle (Peter
J. C. Moses, 9/10/2003).
</p><p>
X(371) is the perspector of several pairs of triangles associated
with Lucas circles. Some of these triangles are defined at MathWorld;
e.g. <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LucasCentralTriangle.html" style=
"font-weight: bold">Lucas Central Triangle</a>, and others are
Lucas(L:W) configurations. The latter are generalizations of
configurations associated with Lucas circles, in which the squares are
replaced by rectangles of length-to-width ratio L:W, with length on the
corresponding sideline of ABC. A negative ratio indicates that the
rectangles are directed inward; e.g. Lucas(-1:1) indicates
inward-directed squares, whereas Lucas(1:1) indicates the classical
case of outward-directed squares. These generalizations and the
following properties of X(371) were contributed by Randy Hutson,
9/23/2011. See also X(372) and X(1084).

</p><p>
X(396) is the centroid of the points Ab, Ac, Bc, Ba, Ca, Cb in the construction of the 3rd Fermat-Dao equilateral triangle; see X(16267). Also, X(396) is the center of the ellipse passing through these six points. (Randy Hutson, March 14, 2018)
</p><p>
Let F = X(13), the 1st Fermat point. Let Ab be the point on CA and Ac the point on AB such that FAbAc is an equilateral triangle. Let A' be the midpoint of FAbAc, and define B' and C' cyclically. The triangle A'B'C', here named the <b>7th Fermat-Dao equilateral triangle</b>, is perspective to ABC. The circumcircle of A'B'C' is the pedal circle of X(13) and (X15), and the centroid of A'B'C' is X(396). The perspector of ABC and A'B'C' is X(2), and the centroid of A'B'C' is X(396).

<b>Cyril Parry,</b> Problem 10637, <i>American Mathematical Monthly</i> 105 (1998) 68.
</p><p>
In <b>Cosmin Pohoata,</b> "On the Parry reflection point," <i>Forum Geometricorum</i> 8 (2008), 43-48 <a href="http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2008volume8/FG200806.pdf" style= "font-weight: bold">here</a>, the following is proved:
</p><p>
Let A' be the reflection of vertex A in line BC, and define B', C' cyclically. Let A<sub>t</sub>B<sub>t</sub>C<sub>t</sub> be the tangential triangle of ABC. The circumcircles of the triangles A<sub>t</sub>B'C', A'B<sub>t</sub>C', A'B'C<sub>t</sub> concur in X(399). Moreover, the circumcircles of triangles A'B<sub>t</sub>C<sub>t</sub>, A<sub>t</sub>B'C<sub>t</sub>, A<sub>t</sub>B<sub>t</sub>C' concur in a point Q = X8157), here named the <b>Parry-Pohoata point</b>. Barycentric coordinates for Q, of degree 22 in a,b,c, were found by J. F. Garcia Captit&aacute;n (Hyacinthos #15827, Nov. 19, 2007) and are included in Pohoata's article. Pohoata notes that the point Q lies on the circumcircle of the points X(3), X(4), X(399).
</p><p>
Let I, I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>B</sub>, I<sub>C</sub>, denote the incenter and excenters of ABC. Lawrence Evans (Hyacinthos #6878) found that the circumcircles of the triangles IA'I<sub>A</sub>, IB'I<sub>B</sub>, IC'<sub>C</sub> concur in X(399).
</p><p>
The Pohoata article includes a proof that the circumcircles of the triangles A'I<sub>B</sub>I<sub>C</sub>, I<sub>A</sub>B'I<sub>C</sub>, I<sub>A</sub>I<sub>B</sub>C' also pass through X(399). Similar results involving the Fermat points, X(13) and X(14), are proved.
</p><p>
Pohoata reports that the following points are concyclic: X(13), X(16), X(110), X(399), X(1338), as are the points X(14), X(15), X(110), X(399), X(1337). Randy Hutson adds (Aug. 13, 2012) that the first of
these circles also passes through X(2381), and the second, through X(2380).

In <i>A History of Mathematics,</i> Florian Cajori writes, "H. C.
Gossard of the University of Oklahoma showed in 1916 that the three
Euler lines of the triangles formed by the Euler line and the sides,
taken by twos, of a given triangle, form a triangle . . . perspective
with the given triangle and having the same Euler line." Let ABC be the
given triangle and A'B'C' the Gossard triangle - that is, the triangle
perspective with the given triangle and having the same Euler line. The
lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(402), named the Gosssard perspector by
John Conway (1998).</p>
<p>Actually, X(402) dates back to an article by Christopher Zeeman in
<i>Wiskundige Opgaven</i> 8 (1899-1902) 305. For details, see Paul
Yiu's Hyacinthos message #7536 and others with Gossard in the subject
line. (In ETC, the change of name from Gossard Perspector to
Zeeman-Gossard Perspector was made on Oct. 15, 2003.) Further details
are given by Wilson Stothers in Hyacinthos #8383, Oct. 21, 2003.</p>

X(493) is a homothetic center of triangles associated with squares that circumscribe ABC. For details, see <a href= "http://home.wxs.nl/~lamoen/wiskunde/vierkant4.html" style="font-style: italic">Vierkanten in een driehoek: 4. Ingeschreven vierkanten</a> (Floor van Lamoen, 4/27/98)

X(493) is the homothetic center of triangle ABC and the Lucas homothetic triangle; see X(371). Writing t for the ratio L:W at X(371), let L<sub>A</sub> be the line through the intersections, other than A, of the A-Lucas(t) circle and sides CA and AB. Define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let A' = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically. Then the triangle A'B'C', here introduced as the Lucas(t) homothetic triangle, is homothetic to triangle ABC. If t = 1, the center of homothety is X(493); for t = -1, it is X(494); for t = 2, it is X(588); and for t = -2, it is X(589). (Randy Hutson, February 9, 2013)

<br>Joe Goggins (Oct. 19, 2005) found trilinears for points in this
section, using the following notation. Let
<p>F(13) = a csc(A + &pi;/3) + b csc(B + &pi;/3) + c csc(C +
&pi;/3)<br>F(14) = a csc(A - &pi;/3) + b csc(B - &pi;/3) + c csc(C - &pi;/3)<br>These are based on trilinears for the isogonic centers, X(13) and
X(14). In like manner, F(I) is defined for I = 15, 16, 17, 18, 61,
62.</p>
<p>Using this notation, we have, for example,<br>X(616) = F(13)/a - 2 csc(A + &pi;/3) : F(13)/b - 2 csc(B + &pi;/3) :
F(13)/c - 2 csc(C + &pi;/3)<br>X(617) = F(14)/a - 2 csc(A - &pi;/3) : F(14)/b - 2 csc(B - &pi;/3) :
F(14)/c - 2 csc(C - &pi;/3)</p>
<p>Trilinears of this sort are given below at X(i) for these I:
616-619, 621-624, 627-630, and 633-636.<br>

<p>
James Blaikie (1847-1929) proposed the following problem. Let O be any point in the plane of triangle ABC, and let any straight line g through O meet BC in P, CA in Q, AB in R; then, if points P', Q', R' be taken on the line so that
PO = OP', QO = OQ', RO = OR'. Prove that AP', BQ', CR' concur.
</p><p>
Darij Grinberg introduces the term <i>Blaikie point of O and g</i> for the point Z of concurrence. If
</p><p>
O
= x : y : z and g = [k : l : m] (barycentric coordinates),
</p><p>
then Z has first barycentric 1/[k(y-z) - (ly-mz)]. Given a point S = u : v : w, Grinberg then defines the <i>S-Blaikie transform of O</i> as the Blaikie point of O and OS. The first barycentric of Z can be written as

Let Ha be the hyperbola passing through A, and with foci at B and C. This is called the A-Soddy hyperbola in (Paul Yiu, Introduction to the Geometry of the Triangle, 2002; 12.4 The Soddy hyperbolas, p. 143). Let La be the polar of X(3) with respect to Ha. Define Lb and Lc cyclically. Let A' = Lb &cap; Lc, B' = Lc &cap; La, C' = La &cap; Lb. Triangle A'B'C' is homothetic to ABC, and its orthocenter is X(944). (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2018)

Let Ma be the polar of X(4) wrt the circle centered at A and passing through X(1), and define Mb, Mc cyclically. (Note: X(4) is the perspector of any circle centered at a vertex of ABC.) Let A" = Mb &cap; Mc, and define B" and C" cyclically. Triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, and its orthocenter is X(944). (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2018)
