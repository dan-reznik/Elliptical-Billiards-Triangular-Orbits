Consider the family of non-intersecting, pentagonal ($N=5$) orbits in an elliptic billiard, $a/b=1.5$. Each pentagon contains two distinct subtriangles (up to cyclic symmetry), e.g., defined by vertices 123 and 124:

```{r,echo=F,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("subtris/subtris_N=5.png")
```

Each row below depicts the locus of $X(i)$, $i=1,2,\ldots 100$ for those subtriangles shown combined and separately.

```{r,echo=F}
fnames <- as.character(fs::dir_ls("loci_pent"))
```

```{r,echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(fnames)
```
